    \begin{itemize}
        \item Beef 1 kg chuck shoulder
        \item Barolo wine 750 ml - (1 bottle)
        \item Carrots 160 g
        \item Celery 100 g
        \item Yellow onions 180 g
        \item Garlic 1 clove
        \item Rosemary 1 sprig
        \item Bay leaves 2 leaves
        \item Cloves 3
        \item Ground black pepper 4
        \item Cinnamon sticks 1
        \item Butter 1 tbsp
        \item Extra virgin olive oil 50 g
        \item Fine salt to taste
    \end{itemize}
\paragraph{Cooking Steps}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item To prepare the braised meat with Barolo, start by making a seasoning bag. Put the cloves, peppercorns and cinnamon in a piece of sterile gauze 1. Close and tie off with kitchen string 2. Then also tie rosemary and bay leaves and movo on to the vegetables 3.
        \item Clean the celery, carrot and onion, cut into 3/4 - 1" (2-3) cm thick chunks, then clean the garlic clove 4. Put the meat, vegetables, the bag and the seasonings into a large bowl 5. Then cover everything with wine with the meat is completely covered 6.
        \item Then cover with transparent wrap and let marinate in the fridge for at least 8-12 hours 7. After the time has passed, drain everything without throwing away the base 8. Take out the meat and place it on the cutting board, dry it with absorbent paper 9.
        \item In a frying pan, melt the butter in the oil over medium heat 10. As soon as the base is hot, add the meat and brown over a high heat 11. Turn it on all sides so that a crust forms on the surface 12.
        \item After a few minutes transfer the meat and its base into a large saucepan 13, heat for a moment over medium heat and add the drained vegetables 14 and let them season over a lower heat for about 15 minutes 15.
        \item At this point you can add salt and cover up to half of the meat with the marinade 16. Bring to a boil and then close with a lid, lower the flame a bit and let it simmer for 1 hour 17. After the time has passed, turn over18
        \item and, only if it is needed, add a little more marinade liquid 19. Continue cooking for another hour 20. Once the braised meat is cooked, take it out of the pot and put it aside on a plate covered with a lid. Remove the seasonings 21.
        \item Before blending the vegetables and the base of the cooking liquid 22 with an immersion mixer, you can collect some liquid and keep it aside. This way you can add to it if needed to obtain the desired consistency 23. In the meantime, slice the meat, to obtain 2-3 slices per person 24 and place on a serving plate; dab the slices with the sauce. Your braised beef with Barolo wine is ready, enjoy!

Almond crusted chicken schnitzel

Traditionally, schnitzels are coated in crisp breadcrumbs, but this delicious version using almonds and cornflour makes this nuttily delicious and suitable for anyone avoiding gluten.

Prep 5 min
Cook 45 min
Serves 4

4 small boneless, skinless chicken breasts
50g parmesan, roughly chopped
250g blanched almonds
Zest of 1 lemon
50g cornflour
Sea salt and black pepper
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tbsp dijon mustard
Lemon wedges, to serve

Put a chicken breast between two sheets of baking paper, then use a rolling pin to beat the chicken until it’s about 1.5cm thick all over. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts.

Put the parmesan in a food processor and blitz until finely chopped. Add the almonds and blitz again until you have a coarse crumb. Transfer to a shallow bowl and stir in the lemon zest.

Place the cornflour in a separate shallow bowl and season generously. Combine the eggs, mustard, and a tablespoon of water in a shallow bowl and whisk to combine. Dust the chicken evenly in cornflour, shake off any excess, then dip into the egg mixture and press into the almond mixture, coating evenly. Place on a baking tray lined with baking paper.

To cook the schnitzels, put a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, then pour in 1cm oil. When the oil is hot, fry two schnitzels for five or six minutes on each side, until golden and cooked through. Repeat with the remaining schnitzels, using a little more oil if needed. Serve with lemon wedges, salad, some potatoes or a side of pickles.



Wine sauce: caramelized onions, thyme and rosemary, wine, black garlic, beef stock.
Gravy: onion, carrot, celery, garlic, thyme, beer, chicken stock.



Add sauce liquid to the corn starch instead of cold water


Blanche vegetables, and save them for the week and eat them as is or steam them in a skillet.
Unique beer styles: Smoked German, Oud Bruin, Brett, Braggot, Freezed-distilled
