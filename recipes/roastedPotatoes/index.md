## Ingredients
- Kosher salt
- 4 g baking soda
- 2 kg of potatoes
- 75 ml extra-virgin olive oil, duck fat, goose fat, or beef fat
- Small handful picked fresh rosemary leaves
- 3 medium cloves garlic
- Ground black pepper
- Salt
- Small handful fresh parsley leaves

## Directions

### Boiling the potatoes
- Heat two liters of water in a large pot over until boiling.
- Preheat oven to 200°C using convection.
- Peel and cut potatoes into quarters or sixths.
- Add to the water pot 2 tablespoons of salt, the baking soda, and the potatoes and stir.
- Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.

### Preparing the oil
- Warm a skillet to medium heat.
- Mince the garlic.
- Chop rosemary.
- Combine the fat with rosemary, garlic, and black pepper.
- Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes.
- Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl.
- Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside.

### Preparing the potatoes for the oven
- When potatoes are cooked, drain  and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds.
- Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.
- Transfer potatoes to a baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly.

### Potatoes in the oven
- Transfer to oven and roast, without moving for 20 minutes.
- Release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes.
- Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.

### Finishing
- Mince parsley.
- Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley.
- Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
